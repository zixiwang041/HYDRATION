# HYDRATION

tracking the hydration you drink everyday.

Low water intake may cause dry skin and cracked skin, and low water intake is not good for health.
Maintaining water circulation in the body is an important part of human health in modern society, so we developed a project to record weekly water intake to help everyone develop better habits.

This is our Hydration Tracker Task Board
